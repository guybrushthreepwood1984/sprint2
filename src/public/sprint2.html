    Timer: periodisch, ohne Input <br />
    <br />

    Were you wondering how the much-used but a little confusing concepts of
    "debounce", "throttle" and "memoize" are working? <br /><br />
    Click through this page and you'll get it! <br /><br />
    debounce: Inputfield, counter keystrokes and execution of function only
    executes once after event(s) finish <br /><br />

    throttle: mousemove or scroll slows down execution <br /><br />
    memoize: Fibonacci: time elapsed saves time and money: don't calculate what
    you already know: only calculate <br /><br />
